    "# About Python Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are a way to interleave code, text, and outputs in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook consists of a series of cells (or blocks). Each cell can contain either code or text (formatted using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)). When you run a code cell, the code is executed, and the output is displayed directly below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell can be executed independently, but the state of the notebook is shared across all cells. This means that variables defined in one cell can be used in another cell, as long as the cell defining the variable has been executed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the [Jupyter extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) to get additional features and better integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you also have the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed, as it provides support for Python code execution within notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the extensions are installed, create a new notebook file with the `.ipynb` extension or open an existing one. You can add new cells, run code, and see outputs directly within VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a code cell, click the \"Run\" button (a triangle icon) that appears to the left of the cell when you hover over it, or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`. This will execute the cell and move the cursor to the next cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to select the \"kernel\" (the Python interpreter) for your notebook. You can do this by clicking on the kernel name in the top right corner of the notebook interface and selecting the appropriate Python environment/version that is installed and detected by VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more extensive guide is available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)."
